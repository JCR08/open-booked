Pitch

The problem with trying to book a Disney vacation is that most of the information you’re going to find is prodded by Disney itself. This means that no matter what a person is looking at it’s going to be rated 5 stars, best of the best.  While I am an avid Disney enthusiast, I’ll be the first to admit that that is not always the case. There are of course plenty of mom forums that will give some more truthful advice, but that’s hoping you manage to stumble upon the one overly long thread that actually pertains to what the person planning the trip wants to know.

With Open Book Disney (name is a work in progress) people will have an easier time finding the specific information they are looking for, whether it be about an attraction, a restaurant, or hotel as well as leave meaningful comments and feedback about their specific experiences. Did you love it, but don’t think it’s worth the 2 hour wait? Leave a comment. Which restaurant will be the best option for mom and dad for that night grandma watches the kids back at the hotel?

Who wants unwelcome surprises once you’re already on vacation? With this app, it turns Disney vacation planning into an Open Book!
